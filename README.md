**Day 13 of My Python Learning Journey â€“ Solving Basic Array Questions in Python**

Today I practiced a series of beginner-friendly array (list) questions in Python. These exercises are essential for developing confidence in handling data structures, especially lists â€” one of the most used in Python.

Hereâ€™s what I worked on:

ğŸ”¹ **Q1. Create an array of 5 numbers and print it**

ğŸ”¹ **Q2. Access the third element of the array**

ğŸ”¹ **Q3. Change the second element to 100**

ğŸ”¹ **Q4. Add a number at the end of the array**

ğŸ”¹ **Q5. Remove the first element from the array**

ğŸ”¹ **Q6. Print the length of the array**

ğŸ”¹ **Q7. Print all elements using a for loop**

ğŸ”¹ **Q8. Check if the number 10 is in the array**

ğŸ”¹ **Q9. Sort the array in ascending order**

ğŸ”¹ **Q10. Reverse the array**

ğŸ§  These questions helped me strengthen my understanding of basic list operations like accessing, modifying, appending, removing, checking membership, and more.

ğŸ“Œ Key Takeaway: Practicing small questions daily builds the logic and flow required for solving real-world problems efficiently using Python.
